# App Template

## Background

Since Helm [library charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/) cannot be
installed directly I have created a companion chart for the [common library](../common-library/index.md).

## Usage

This Helm chart can be used to deploy any application. Knowing the specifics of the application you want to deploy
like the image, ports, env vars, args, and/or any config volumes will be required. You can also use [Kubesearch](https://kubesearch.dev/)
to search for applications people have deployed with this Helm chart.

In order to use this template chart, you would deploy it as you would any other Helm chart.
By setting the desired values, the common library chart will render the desired resources.

Be sure to check out the [common library docs](../common-library/index.md)
and its [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/library/common/values.yaml) for
more information about the available configuration options.

#### Examples

This is an example `values.yaml` file that would deploy the [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
application. For more deployment examples, check out the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/tree/main/examples/).

```yaml linenums="1"
--8<--
examples/helm/vaultwarden/values.yaml

```

## Upgrade instructions

### From 2.x.x to 3.0.x

The main changes from v2.x to v3.x are the removal of the default `main` objects and the introduction of JSON schema validation.

!!! warning

    **IMPORTANT** The introduction of the json schema adds additional validations and restrictions on the contents of your chart values.
    Things may have been missed during the initial schema creation, so if you run in to any unexpected validation errors please [raise an issue](https://github.com/bjw-s-labs/helm-charts/issues/new?assignees=bjw-s&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.md&title=)

Given the following real-life example values.yaml for app-template v2:

#### Changes in this example

This is not meant as an exhaustive list of changes, but rather a "most common" example.

- The `main` object for controllers, containers, services and ingress has been removed from `values.yaml` and will therefore no longer provide any (both expected and unexpected) default values.
- The `config` object for persistence has been removed from `values.yaml` and will therefore no longer provide any (both expected and unexpected) default values.
- `enableServiceLinks` has been disabled by default. In order to explicitly enable serviceLinks, set the value to `true`.
- `ingress.*.hosts.*.paths.*.service` Service references now require either `name` or `identifier` to be set.
- Persistence items of type `configMap` and `secret` object references now allow either `name` or `identifier` to be set.

### From 1.x.x to 2.0.x

!!! warning

    **IMPORTANT** Because a new label has been introduced in the controller labelSelector (which is an immutable field), Deployments cannot be upgraded in place!
    [More details](https://www.datree.io/resources/kubernetes-error-codes-field-is-immutable)

!!! info

    Some items (Ingress, ports, persistence items, etc) now default to being enabled by default. However, this is not always the case for some of the `items due to overrides in the default `values.yaml`.

#### Changes in this example

This is not meant as an exhaustive list of changes, but rather a "most common" example.

- `podSecurityContext` has been moved to `defaultPodOptions.securityContext`. It is also possible to configure this on a controller-specific basis by moving it to `controllers.main.pod.securityContext` instead.
- `image` has been moved to `controllers.main.containers.main.image` so that multiple containers can be configured.
- `ingress.media.ingressClassName` has been renamed to `ingress.main.className`.
- `ingress.media.enabled` can be removed, since items are considered enabled by default (they can still be disabled by adding `enabled: false`).
- `ingress.media.hosts.*.paths.*.service` is now required since there is no more concept of a default "primary" service.
- `persistence.media.mountPath` has been moved to `persistence.media.globalMounts.*.path` to allow multiple mountPaths for the same persistence item.
- `persistence.media.enabled` can be removed, since items are considered enabled by default (they can still be disabled by adding `enabled: false`).
- `probes` has been moved to `controllers.main.containers.main.probes` so that multiple containers can be configured.
